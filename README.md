# React-Express (Work in progress!)

This project is just a quick boilerplate to help me get up and running with thefollowing:

- React
- Node (Express)
- Prettier (Formatting)
- Eslint (Linting)
- Babel (ES6 Javascript)
- Dotenv (for secrets)


(Directory structure might change in the future)

## /src
All server logic is in here. Most of this was inspired by Jason Miller's repo.

## /client
Create-React-App boilerplate is here. Edit all your front-end source code here. You can also modify the eslint and prettier config files. We are proxying CRA to port 8080 in order to talk to express.
